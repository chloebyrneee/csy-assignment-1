      Before starting university I was really looking forward to web development as it isn’t something I had done before. Northampton uni stood out the most to me because of this, not a lot of other unis offer web development on a games development course. I have always wanted to do web development but I have never had the chance to get into it until now.
      In this term of web development, I haven’t found it easy that’s for sure. I think the thing I most struggled with is the CCS design, I found it hardest to design my website the way I liked.
      I started off with a slightly different idea for my web design but the most part it’s all the same. I knew I wanted a navigation bar at the top, and random inspirational quotes to break up the web pages, and give people something else to read incase they didn’t want to read my words of jibberish but, for example, on my landing page I wanted to have Kathryn’s bio on the left and my bio on the right. There were just too many elements I needed to style in order for this to look right from my own code. 
      Also, I found that this was really hard to style in such a way where if you change the screen size it would still look okay especially on a phone view. I knew for sure I didn’t just want it to look alright when it was on a big screen, because that defeats the purpose of a good web page. Never the less I changed the styling of my elements to make it look alright whatever size it was, I did this mostly by having everything underneath each other but I did show off some of my skills in the intro page where I managed to get two elements side by side and it to look okay. 
      I have really enjoyed the first term of web development but feel as though I could have put more time and effort outside of uni to be able to make a stunning website.
