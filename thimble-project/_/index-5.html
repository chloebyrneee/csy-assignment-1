    <p>
     I choose to do my whole website based off it being consistant all thr way throughout. My favourite colour is black, hence why most things are black, but most of all I wanted a nice navigation bar and a following image and quote on all pages. I found this to be one of the most popular designs on the web at the moment, and really liked the idea.  <br>
      I choose the first page to be all about me and my team, and the rest of the pages different things as I found that as the landing page to be the best. <br>
      I found that the best way to catch someone's eye on a webpage are more images than words, which is why I have written the least amount possible, plus words look ugly on a webpage. <br>
      I wanted my website to be clean and simple throughout the whole of my design process, and I didn't want much going on within other aspects as this draws the users attention away to the main content of the page. <br>
      I really worked on the starting of the page, but found that styling long amounts of words to be difficult, so I tried to keep it as simple as possible to allow the user to choose whether to read it or not, and if they do, they have nothing else distracting them.

    <h1> Modes of good practice</h1>
    <p> <a href = "https://4rsmokehouse.com/catering/"> A really good website </a>
      <br>
      This website is a great website because it has a highly responsive design and really nice to look at, while giving you all the information you need and being fairly simple.

      Below, you can see a really simple wireframe I created before I started creating this website.
