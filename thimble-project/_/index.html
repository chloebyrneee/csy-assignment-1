    <h2>About Chloe</h2>
      <img class = "chloe" src="assets/ff2f4cd8b1b64f43d414b38f51df4fa9.png" alt="Image description" />
      <p> Hi, i'm Chloe, the main creator of this website. At the moment, i spend most of my time either doing uni work or working at my job, which is working in a cinema. If im not doing any of those things, usually i'm out with friends, or taking advantage of my job perks (free films!) I also love really lazy days where I can chill in bed and catch up on the massive amounts of loss sleep I usually get. My favourite type of film is action, but if it's got a good storyline, I can really watch anything. I love punk/rock music and my favourite band at the moment is Mayday Parade. I ride a motorbike to get around to places like uni or work, my motorbike is my baby</p>

    <p class = "websiteParagraph"> Here I go through the main 3 sites I used as inspiration for my website. I couldn't have put it better than these websites, they say how it is and what needs to be said. Briefly I scroll through where you can see some of the main points of a good website, and then go go ahead and click onto the website I mainly based mine off. <br>
